    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know a lot of people dislike Perl, but I programmed a lot of large applications in it for many years. I agree that it can be difficult for programmers new to Perl to pick up on some of its nuances, but I disagree that it&#8217;s a complete mess/line noise/write-only. Good clean code can be written in any language, just like horrible disgusting code can be written in any language.</p>

<p>A while back I saw a <a href="http://raid6.com.au/~onlyjob/posts/arena/">language speed shootout</a>, whereby the same version of a script was written in many different languages and compared against each other to see how quickly they ran. Surprisingly, Perl has been so well optimized, that its performance was right on par with the C and C++ versions of the test. PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, etc. were all comparatively much slower. You could see the iterations of each getting much longer as the memory use increased. Yet Perl (and the C&#8217;s) stayed pretty consistent throughout.</p>

<p>Not being satisfied with someone else&#8217;s benchmarks, I ran the programs on a local machine. While the times were different, the results were nearly identical in terms of performance trends.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Last year when I was hiring a developer for my team, I used the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz">FizzBuzz</a> application as a coding exercise for the candidates to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html">weed out the people that claimed they could program but couldn&#8217;t</a>. Of course, this lead to a throw-down amongst the current crew as to how each of us would write it if we had too.</p>

<p>I eventually came up with my minimalist version, then realized that with just a few tweaks, I could make the code run under either Perl of PHP. Seeing is that FizzBuzz is a very simple program, and not a memory resource hog like the original benchmark shootout was, I was curious to see how something that simple would perform in a shootout.</p>

<p>I quickly modified the program and made it identical for Perl and PHP (other than the <code>&lt;php</code> tag at the top of the PHP version and the shebang line at the top of the Perl version). The results of the benchmark were surprising! Even with this ultra-simple example of exactly identical code, Perl was significantly (5.5x) faster.</p>

    <link href="http://www.markbadolato.com/blog/2013/08/23/notification-when-switchin-git-branches/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-23T23:24:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.markbadolato.com/blog/2013/08/23/notification-when-switchin-git-branches</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At my office, we frequently find ourselves switching between Git branches and often we forget to run <code>composer install</code> on the new branch to make sure our vender dependencies are at the proper versions for the branch we changed to.</p>

<p>For example, <code>master</code> is stable and has an older version of a dependency, but a feature branch I&#8217;m working on uses an updated version of that dependency.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m currently working on a feature branch when a bug report comes in and I need to fix the problem ASAP. If I stash my current feature branch&#8217;s files, then create a new bug-fix branch off of master, my <code>composer.lock</code> file is different and my <code>vendor/</code> directory still contains the newer version of the dependency. This occasionally causes problems.</p>

<p>A while back I found a helpful script to use as a post-checkout Git hook. Now whenever I switch branches, I get a notification telling me my dependencies are different than the branch I just switched from.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.markbadolato.com/images/misc/branch_switch.png" /></p>

<p>To use this script on a single project, put the following in your project&#8217;s <code>.git/hooks/post-checkout</code> file (create it if it does not already exist). Make sure to set the file permissions to executable.</p>

<p>I prefer to keep the script in my global <code>git-core/templates/hooks/post-checkout</code> file so it&#8217;s accessible for all of my projects. <strong>Tip:</strong> After installing the file, run <code>git init</code> in an existing project to update the hooks and bring the global file down locally to your project.</p>

<pre><code class="bash /usr/local/share/git-core/templates/hooks/post-checkout">#!/bin/bash

PREV_COMMIT=$1
POST_COMMIT=$2

NOCOLOR='\x1B[0m'
REDCOLOR='\x1B[37;41m'

if [[ -f composer.lock ]]; then
    DIFF=`git diff --shortstat $PREV_COMMIT..$POST_COMMIT composer.lock`
    if [[ $DIFF != "" ]]; then
        echo -e "$REDCOLOR composer.lock has changed. You must run composer install$NOCOLOR"
    fi
fi
</code></pre>

<p><em>Please note: This script is modified to properly display color codes on a Mac/BSD system. If you&#8217;re on Linux and having display issues, change the instances of <code>\x1B</code> to <code>\e</code> and it will work for you.</em></p>
